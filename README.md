## Theme Engine

### Overview
The `ThemeEngine` class is responsible for managing themes within the application. It ensures that only theme-related code evolves and operates within a very tight memory constraint.

### Usage
To use the `ThemeEngine`, follow these steps:
1. Initialize the `ThemeEngine` in your activity:
   ```java
   ThemeEngine themeEngine = new ThemeEngine(this);
   ```
2. Apply the theme using the `applyTheme` method:
   ```java
   themeEngine.applyTheme();
   ```

### Memory Constraints
The `ThemeEngine` enforces a memory constraint to ensure that theme-related code does not exceed a specified memory limit. This helps prevent any potential breakout code.

### Permission Control
The `ThemeEngine` includes permission control mechanisms to restrict the evolution of theme-related code. This ensures that only authorized code can modify the theme settings.
